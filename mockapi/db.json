With this practical guide, Yahoo! web developer Stoyan Stefanov teaches you how to build components—React’s basic building blocks—and organize them into maintainable, large-scale apps. If you’re familiar with basic JavaScript syntax, you’re ready to get started. Once you understand how React works, you’ll build a complete custom Whinepad app that helps users rate wines and keep notes. You’ll quickly learn why some developers consider React the key to the web app development puzzle. Set up React and write your first \"Hello world\" web app Create and use custom React components alongside generic DOM components Build a data table component that lets you edit, sort, search, and export its contents Use the JSX syntax extension as an alternative to function calls Set up a lean, low-level build process that helps you focus on React Build a complete custom app that lets you store data on the client Use ESLint, Flow, and Jest tools to check and test your code as your app evolves Manage communication between components with Flux",

The material is kept up to date by me and the community.In the Road to learn React, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information around React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world React application.You will learn to build your own React application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript and helps you to get started.",

With a little JavaScript experience under your belt, you'll be up and running in no time creating dynamic web applications. Craft isolated components that make your apps easier to develop and maintain, with plenty of guidance on best practices. Set up automated tests, and make pages render fast for your users. See how to use your React skills to integrate with other front-end technologies when needed. Dive right into React by defining components, the basic building blocks of a React application. Integrate modern JavaScript language features such as classes and arrow functions in your app. Analyze the relationships in your data to isolate state, and sync the data model with what your users see. Once you're familiar with how a React application works, organize your code base with modules. Configure a production build and deliver your app as efficiently as possible with Webpack. Master testing with React-specific advice and tools to catch the most bugs with the least amount of code. Learn the basics of the Redux library. Define actions and manage an immutable central state with reducers, then connect Redux to your React components to build even larger and more complex interfaces. Package your React code as a standalone widget so anyone can use it in their own applications. Reuse existing JavaScript code in your React components, and build a new React view on top of an existing data model shared with a legacy application. When you finish this book, you'll be well on your way to solving your front-end problems with React. What You Need: Node.js 6.x or later, and a modern web browser.",

This book explores the React library in depth, as well as detailing additional tools and libraries in the React ecosystem, enabling you to create complete, complex applications. You will learn how to use React completely, and learn best practices for creating interfaces in a composable way. You will also cover additional tools and libraries in the React ecosystem (such as React Router and Flux architecture). Each topic is covered clearly and concisely and is packed with the details you need to learn to be truly effective. The most important features are given no-nonsense, in-depth treatment, and every chapter details common problems and how to avoid them. If you already have experience creating front-end apps using jQuery or perhaps other JavaScript frameworks, but need to solve the increasingly common problem of structuring complex front-end applications, then this book is for you. Start working with React like a pro - add Pro React to your library today.",

No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications. Style and approach Split into three major sections to help organize your learning, this hands-on, code-first book will help you get up to speed with React and React Native—the UI framework that powers Netflix, Yahoo, and Facebook.",

In it, Hessel asserts that today’s youth should assume the same indignation that his generation in its turn had against Nazism and capitalism, as well as indignation against financial capital inequality what Israel does in Palestine (it is worth remembering that Hessel is Jewish) and the indifference that has gripped the world in the face of the injustices and inefficiencies of the current financial economic system. It is a beautiful text, less than 30 pages long, and has been largely successful. I bought the 13th edition in French in Hamburg. Next to a bookshop in a café Balzac, I read the entire text and, inspired by Hessel, who I would meet some months after, wrote this “React”.",
